<h1>Protecting the environment</h1>
<p>The environment plays a vital role in sustaining life on Earth by offering essential resources. It also supports biodiversity, which is key to ecosystem stability. Additionally, the state of the environment directly affects human health and overall well-being.
</p>

<ul>Recycling is important so we can reduce the amount of rubbish exposed to animal life.</ul>
<ul>Saving water is important as it reduces the risk of running out of water that which we need for hydration.</ul>
<ul>Reducing plastic is crucial for the environment as animals such as birds could pick it up and choke and die from it.</ul>
<ul>Less fossil fuels or factory work is important so we aren't releasing any smoke which can be harmful to the environment into the atmosphere.</ul>
